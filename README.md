As you already know, we do not have a place to look at the exact cost of the courier services we use when sending a parcel abroad from Sri Lanka. Even though there is a price calculator on the websites of those companies, often the prices displayed online are different (less / more) than what an agent says. There are several reasons for this.

 1. Fuel Surcharge
 2. The value of the dollar in proportion to the rupee
 3. Differences in handling charges between country zones

There are a lot of things like this.

So we thought of writing a small web app for this formula as a solution to this. This price calculator was developed as a result of that.

Currently the data is available only from the UPS courier. In the future we hope to add data from services like DHL and FedEx.
